## Objective
The total duration for all 3 Videos are almost 36 Hours. I want to complete it within 10 days. It seems impossible but I am an MCA student and I already know the basics of programming. Moreover I am from ICSE background in which we are taught Java since class IX and continues till class XII. So basically I have good grab of basic foundation as a aresult of which I might be able to complete it within the required time frame as per myself.

## Day 1 (27/10-2024)
Unit 1:  This unit was almost of an hour where I learnt about how Java came into picture and why it was renamed and also some of the buzzwords associated with Java. I also learned about why there was a need of Java which brought a craze and took Java to next level.

Unit 2: An hour of content where I learnt and Wrote first program to print "Hello World" and got to know about Java's Magical thing "The ByteCode". Also covered the concept of JDK vs JRE vs JVM. How to print in different ways in Java along with a program. Also learned about the main method and why is it writtens so.

-----------------
## Day 2 (28/10-2024)
Unit 3: Cleared various concept in the first hour such as Data Types and Variables in Java. How RAM comes into th epicture during memory allocation and Escape Sequences. Then, naming convention of variables and rules to be followed while naming the variables.

Unit 3: Started of with user input in java and a program to take all kinds of data from user input. 

------------
## Day 3 (29/10-2024)
Unit 3: Started off with type casting and a program to implement it.

Unit 4: This unit consist of different kinds of operator in Java like assignment operator, arithmetic operator. Order of operation is very important to consider if we have same operators repeated multiple times in a expression. It executes everything starting from left to right. Then we have short hand operator which is just a short cut for arithmetic and other operators to program more efficiently. Next, we moved to unary operators, increment and decrement along with a practise program. After that we solved almost 7 practise problem to get better grasp on these fundamental stuff.


Unit 4: After that we were good to with if-else part and along with it I covered other operators such as logical operator, relational operator and then solved practise problem to end today's session as time was up.
