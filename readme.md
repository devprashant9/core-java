## Objective
The total duration for all 3 Videos are almost 36 Hours. I want to complete it within 10 days. It seems impossible but I am an MCA student and I already know the basics of programming. Moreover I am from ICSE background in which we are taught Java since class IX and continues till class XII. So basically I have good grab of basic foundation as a aresult of which I might be able to complete it within the required time frame as per myself.

## Day 1 (27/10-2024)
Unit 1:  This unit was almost of an hour where I learnt about how Java came into picture and why it was renamed and also some of the buzzwords associated with Java. I also learned about why there was a need of Java which brought a craze and took Java to next level.

Unit 2: An hour of content where I learnt and Wrote first program to print "Hello World" and got to know about Java's Magical thing "The ByteCode". Also covered the concept of JDK vs JRE vs JVM. How to print in different ways in Java along with a program. Also learned about the main method and why is it writtens so.

-----------------
## Day 2 (28/10-2024)
Unit 3: Cleared various concept in the first hour such as Data Types and Variables in Java. How RAM comes into th epicture during memory allocation and Escape Sequences. Then, naming convention of variables and rules to be followed while naming the variables.

Unit 3: Started of with user input in java and a program to take all kinds of data from user input. 

------------
## Day 3 (29/10-2024)
Unit 3: Started off with type casting and a program to implement it.

Unit 4: This unit consist of different kinds of operator in Java like assignment operator, arithmetic operator. Order of operation is very important to consider if we have same operators repeated multiple times in a expression. It executes everything starting from left to right. Then we have short hand operator which is just a short cut for arithmetic and other operators to program more efficiently. Next, we moved to unary operators, increment and decrement along with a practise program. After that we solved almost 7 practise problem to get better grasp on these fundamental stuff.


Unit 4: After that we were good to with if-else part and along with it I covered other operators such as logical operator, relational operator and then solved practise problem to end today's session as time was up.

------------
## Day 4 (30/10-2024)
Unit 4: Today also we are continuing with the same unit where in the first part we learnt precedence of operator and their associativity and made notes related to the same and then moved on to Number System. After which we started Bitwise Operator. The video only focuses on theory part for better clarity and understanding. Bitwise Operator are bit confusing to understand and they aren't used on taht scale. However, it is used in DSA which is important for me so I need to explore it from other resources. Then we perform a few simple programs to implement Bitwise Operators and a practical program to find "Even Odd Using Bitwise Operator".


Unit 5: First we learnt about comments in java. Next, we moved to loops in java and different types of loop and their implementation in java and at the same time we covered functions in java too. Skipped this part a little as it was very theoretical. Jumped this part basically just like function 😂. After this I solved the Challenge part which has almost 10 questions.

> Struggle: Invested almost 40 minutes on GCD and LCM Program to properly understand the approach to solve it and why GCD should be used to find LCM and the overflow problem as LCM becomes very large. Tested both the programs for all general possible cases.

Invested an extra hour today to solve all challenge questions using functions. It was almost a session for 4 continious hours with no break. Will get completed by tomorrow. Cheers 🍻.

------------
## Day 5 (31/10-2024)
Unit 5: In this unit our topic was Array and basic fundamentals of array data structure. How do we declrae arrays, and how to access values in arrays. Size of arrays cannot be changed. Then we practised few programs to get better at array. After that we covered 2D arrays in java with a program to implement it. Then we started with the challenge part to "**END THE FIRST VIDEO 🥳🥳**"

> Completed the Tutorial 1 in just 5 days. It is not normal for a absolute beginner person but however it also has helped me. Like, when you know some stuff you basically skip it but in this challenge I was very focused and watched the entire video at 1.5x and solved all challenges question which has helped me to become patient and consistent at the same time. Not even for a single second I felt like "Oh! I know this let jump to the next section". So the reward is to be "**Patient**" and "**Consistent**" and to be "**Focused**" at the same time in order to learn new things.
