String is an object
String don't need to be instantiated

    Ques: How can we concatenate 2 objects using + operator
    Ques: Why it does not need instantiation

Strings are declared in a Heap Memory area named "String Pool"
Strings are Immutable
Strings are comapred using equals() method and comparing it with "==" will compare the reference address of the strings.
The equals() method is present to all the objects by default
Concatening strings consumes more memory as strings are immutable

String Formatting:
    just like C Language
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + " your marks is " + marks);
    System.out.printf("Hello, %s your marks is: %d" + name, marks);

    Syntax: % [flags] [width] [.precision] specifier-character
