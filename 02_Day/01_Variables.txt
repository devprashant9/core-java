1. What are variables?
    Variables are like containers used for storing data values.
    Variables have two parts, variable name and variable value.
    All variables are not of same size.

2. What is Memory Allocation?
    Here memory simply means RAM. Whenever we create a variable a small part of memory is assigned so that the value does not get lost and also variable has the name which helps us to reference the memory address.
        
        Eg: int a = 5;

3. What is Variable Declaration and Initialization?
    int a = 5;
        int: data type
        a: variable name
        =: assignment operator. Assigns value present on the right side to the left side.
        5: value to be stored in variable

4. Primitive Data Types in Java

    Data Type       Size        Default Value

    byte            1 byte      0
    short           2 byte      0
    int             4 byte      0
    long            8 byte      0L
    char            2 byte      '\u0000'
    float           4 byte      0.0f
    double          8 byte      0.0d
    boolean         1 byte      false

5. Naming Conventions of Variables
    camelCase: myVariableName
    snake_case: my_variable_name
    kebab-case: my-variable-name

6. Rules for Naming Variable
    These are allowed: [A-Z][a-z][0-9][_, $]
    Must not start with a number
    Names are case sensetive
    Can not use reserved keywords directly like (public, class, void, static, etc.)

7. What are Literals in Java?
    int a = 5;
        Here 5 is a literal as it is a constant value of a declared in the program.

8. What are Keyword in Java?
    Keywords are Java reserved words which cannot be used in our program for any purpose. These words are alreday defined in Java to carry out some specific task.

9. What are Escape Sequences?
    \t: tab
    \b: backspace
    \n: new line
    \': single quote
    \": double quote
    \\: backslash

10. User Input in Java using Scanner class
    int number = sc.nextInt(); 
    float decimal = sc.nextFloat();
    String name = sc.nextLine();
