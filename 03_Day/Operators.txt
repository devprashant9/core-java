    Operators in Java

1. Assignment Operator
    Assigns right-hand opearnd value to left-hand operand.
        Eg: int a  = 5;

2. Arithmetic Operators

        Operators       Meaning             Example        Result
        +               Addition            4 + 2          6
        -               Subtraction         4 - 2          2
        *               Multiplication      4 * 2          8
        /               Division            4 / 2          2
        %               Modulus             4 % 2          0
            *Note: Modulus operator returns remainder after division

3. Order of Operator
    Basically BODMAS rule is followed
    In case of single operator repeated multiple times in a expression, it simply evaluates froml left to right.
        Eg: 9/3/3 = 1 is done in following way ((9/3) / 3) = 1

4. Short Hand Operator

    Value       Short Hand      Meaning     Result
    a           +=              a+ = 5      a = a + 5
    a           -=              a- = 5      a = a - 5
    a           *=              a* = 5      a = a * 5
    a           /=              a/ = 5      a = a / 5
    a           %=              a% = 5      a = a % 5

5. Unary Operator

    Operator        Description                                 Example
    -               Converts +ve value to -ve value             x = -y
    Pre-Increment   Increments value by 1 first                 x = ++y
    Pre-Decrement   Decrements value by 1 first                 x = --y
    Post-Increment  Uses Current Value then decrements by 1     x = y++
    Post-Decrement  Uses Current Value then decrements by 1     x = y--
