Instance vs Local Variables

class Athelete {
    public String; instance variables class scope
    public double;
    public int; 

    public Athelete(name, speed, age) {
        this.atheleteName = name; //local scope
        this.atheleteSpeed = speed;
        this.atheleteage = age;
    }

    public void atheleteRun(){
        int speed = 100; local variable
        System.out.println("Athelete Running at Speed: "+speed);
    }
