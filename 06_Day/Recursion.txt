Recursion in Java

1. self calling function: function calling itself
2. base case: to prevent infinite loop
3. recursive case: where function makes the recursive call
4. stack overflow risk: excessive recursion can cause stack overflow errors
5. problem solving: ideal for solving problem which can be divided into samller problems
