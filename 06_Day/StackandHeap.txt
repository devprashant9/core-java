Stack Memory and Heap Memory

    Stack: Ordered on top of one another. LIFO Structure.
            methods are allocated in stack memory along with variables. Space becomes empty after the method is executed.

    Heap: No particular order.
                objects are allocated in heap memory.
                Refrence are not deleted and remains in memory.

1. Primitive: Memory declared at compile time. Faster to access.

2. Non-Primitive: Memory allocated at run time. Slower than primitive.
