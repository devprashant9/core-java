1. Introduction to Java

1.1 Why Java
    Used on 60B Devices
    Wide Usage (Web Application, Enterprise Software, Mobile Application)
    High Paying and lot of Jobs
    Object Oriented
    Rich APIs and Community Support

1.2 What is Programming Language
    A way of communication between human and computer.

1.3 What is an Algorithm
    Step by Step instructions of a process.

1.4 What is Syntax
    Rules of writing the programming language.

1.5 History of Java
    Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Originally names 'Oak' and later changed to 'Java'.

1.6 Why Java is/was Needed
    Write Once, Run Anywhere. Cross-Platform compatibility. Both Compiled and Interpreted.
        Code -> Compiled -> Byte Code -> JVM -> Machine Code

1.7 Why was Renamed to Java
    Backward and Forward compatibility. James Gosling was fond of coffee beans from Java island. The coffee retains it tastes even after cooking it multiple times. Mainly Golsing wanted Backward Compatibility.

1.8 Magic of Byte Code
    Source Code -> Compiler -> Byte Code -> JVM(Different for Different Machines)

1.9 Java Buzzwords
    Robust: Running smooth constatntly
            Strong memory management, exception handling, type-checking mechanism, prevents system crashes
    
    Multithreaded: Ability of CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently

    Architecture Neutral: Compiled byte code can be run on any machine with the help of JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware architecture.

    Interpreted(High Performance): JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler converts byte code to machine code at run time improving performance.

    Distributed: Inherently distributed and designed to facilitate network based application, development and interaction.

1.10 Object Oriented Programming
    Data Oriented approach
