Encapsulation in Java
    1. Hides internal data, allowing access only through methods
    2. Uses public, private, protected to control access to class members
    3. Provides public methods for controlled property access through getters and setters
    4. Protects objects state from external interference
    5. Keeps classes seperate and reduces coupling
