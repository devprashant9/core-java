    Packages in Java
        Packages are used to remove name conflict in Java
        Packages are nothing but a folder
        Different packages can have same class name
        Duplicate class name cannot exist in same packages
        Package name should be unique in the world like domain name.
        Standard for writing package name is domain name in reverse
            in.example.yourpackagename1;
                Package.java
            in.example.yourpackagename2;
                Package.java
        
        Fully qualified name of package 2 is "in.example.yourpackagename2.Package"
