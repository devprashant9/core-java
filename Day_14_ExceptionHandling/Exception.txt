    What is Exception in Java
    Disruptive event occurs during execution of program, that interrupts normal flow of the program.
    Exception are objects in Java

        Hirerachy of Class

        1. Object
            2. Throwable (Interface)
                2.1 Error (Child)                  2.2 Exception (Child)
                    2.1.1 Unchecked               2.2.1 Run-Time        2.2.2 Compile-Time


Error: These includes problem that rae not caused by programmers or their code logic susch as system out of memory or storage is full.

Exception: These are the problem that occurs because of the code logic

Compile-Time: When it is already known that the particular piece of code might throw an excaption then it becomes necessary to handle it and can't be ignored.

Run-Time: When you know that a piece of code might throw error but not always


    The try-catch block
    1. try contains the code that might throw error
    2. catch helps us not to throw exception directly rather handle it with some feedback. It always follows the try block.
    3. there can be multiple catch blocks but the hirerachy of catching exception should be specific to general.
    4. catch might not handle an exception which is not defined or not handled like general exception


Types of Exception
    1. User Defined Exception
    2. Built-in Exceptions
        i. Checked Exception: Must be Handled Explicitly
        ii. Unchecked Exceptions: Optional to Handle


The throws vs throw keywords

The Finally block: Always executes no matter what problem arises. Ideal for closing resources.
